I noticed there were lots of apps to search through jobs on monthly HN "Who is hiring" threads, but none to search through candidates who posted in "Who wants to be hired".

So I made one! The built app is in the gh-pages branch, and the source code is in the source branch.

Written in React with plain old JS. Although I'd have loved to build this with Reagent in Clojurescript if I had some more time to learn that. Alas, I'm not a cool
dev, just a boring security engineer. So I used the skills I already have to make something that works.

Or maybe it doesn't work - in which case, feel free to create an issue or just submit a PR!

### How it works

It searches for candidates who've posted in the current year and orders them with the newest at top.
